Maintainer: Wilson Ng Fosiu <wilsonkwu@gmail.com>
Description: The EasyCellMarker2 package allows users to easily retrieve cell marker genes from the CellMarker 2.0 database based on specified filters such as species, tissue class, tissue type, and cell name. It provides the corresponding markers along with their source PMID for further analysis. The data in this package comes from the download provided by the official website of CellMarker2.0. We are very grateful for their selfless help in bioinformatics research. The website is: http://117.50.127.228/CellMarker/CellMarker_download.html.  At the same time, since the data in this package is obtained from the local computer, if the official CellMarker2.0 updates the data, there may be some errors in the data in this package. Please forgive us.The date of obtaining the data from CellMarker: October 11, 2024.
